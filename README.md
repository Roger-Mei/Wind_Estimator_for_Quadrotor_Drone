This file is intended to construct a wind estimator for quadrotor drone. 
The main.m is trying to estimate wind in hovering mode. 
To move one step further, the wind_disturbance_with_trajectory.m is estimating the wind while the drone is flying along a trajectory.
For more details, please open the file and see the comment.
